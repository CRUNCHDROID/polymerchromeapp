# Polymer Chrome App

This is starter application based on Polymer Library published by Google. 

In order to build the project to work with Chrome Apps, use `vulcanize` tool (`sudo npm install -g vulcanize`). To build run the following command, after every edit:

`vulcanize --csp -o build.html index.html`

I have heard that `vulcanize` will be available in Chrome Dev Editor by default later on.
